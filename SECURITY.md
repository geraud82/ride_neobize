# üîê Security Configuration Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the NEOBIZE Shuttle Reservation system and provides guidance for maintaining security in production.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Environment Variable Security**
- All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- Separate `.env.example` files with placeholder values
- Production templates with secure defaults
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

### 2. **Backend Security Middleware**

#### Helmet.js
- Sets various HTTP headers for security
- Prevents common vulnerabilities (XSS, clickjacking, etc.)
- Content Security Policy headers

#### Rate Limiting
- Configurable rate limits per IP address
- Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes in production
- Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse

#### CORS Protection
- Whitelist-based origin validation
- Configurable allowed origins
- Credentials support for authenticated requests
- Proper HTTP methods and headers configuration

### 3. **Database Security**
- SSL connections enforced in production
- Connection pooling with timeouts
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- UUID primary keys for better security
- Database constraints and validation

### 4. **Input Validation**
- Comprehensive server-side validation
- Email format validation
- Phone number sanitization
- Address length requirements
- Passenger and luggage limits
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

## üîë Authentication & Authorization

### Admin Authentication
- Environment-based admin credentials
- Simple but secure login system
- Session-based authentication
- Protected admin endpoints

### User Access
- Email-based user identification
- No password storage (email-only access)
- User-specific data isolation

## üìß Email Security

### Gmail SMTP Configuration
- App Password authentication (not regular password)
- TLS encryption for email transmission
- Secure SMTP configuration
- Email validation and sanitization

### Email Content Security
- HTML email sanitization
- No user-generated content in emails
- Structured email templates

## üì± WhatsApp Security (Twilio)

### Twilio Integration
- Secure API authentication
- Webhook URL validation
- Message content sanitization
- Error handling for failed messages

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Security Best Practices

### Connection Security
- SSL/TLS encryption in production
- Connection string security
- Database user permissions
- Connection pooling limits

### Data Protection
- UUID-based primary keys
- Email normalization (lowercase)
- Data validation constraints
- Audit trails with timestamps

## üåê Deployment Security

### Vercel (Frontend)
- HTTPS enforced by default
- Environment variable encryption
- Build-time security scanning
- CDN security headers

### Render (Backend)
- HTTPS enforced by default
- Environment variable encryption
- Container isolation
- Automatic security updates

### Database (Render PostgreSQL)
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Network isolation
- Automated backups
- Access logging

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logging
- Structured error logging
- Security event logging
- Request/response logging
- Database query logging

### Error Handling
- Secure error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful failure handling
- Error tracking integration ready

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Checklist for Production

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables use secure, unique values
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Database uses SSL connections
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] CORS origins are restricted to known domains
- [ ] Admin credentials are strong and unique
- [ ] JWT secrets are cryptographically secure
- [ ] Email uses App Password, not regular password

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] Security headers are properly set
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Rate limiting is working correctly
- [ ] CORS policy is restrictive
- [ ] Admin access is properly secured

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular credential rotation
- [ ] Database backup verification
- [ ] SSL certificate monitoring

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediately rotate affected credentials**:
   - Database passwords
   - API keys (Twilio, Gmail)
   - JWT secrets
   - Admin passwords

2. **Update environment variables** in:
   - Render backend service
   - Vercel frontend project
   - Any other deployment platforms

3. **Monitor for suspicious activity**:
   - Check application logs
   - Review database access logs
   - Monitor email/SMS usage

4. **Notify stakeholders** if customer data may be affected

### Emergency Contacts
- Technical Lead: [Your contact information]
- Security Team: [Security team contact]
- Hosting Support: Render/Vercel support

## üîß Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit`
- **Security Headers**: [Security Headers Checker](https://securityheaders.com/)
- **SSL Testing**: [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
- **CORS Testing**: Browser developer tools

### Security Resources
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [Node.js Security Checklist](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/)
- [Express.js Security Best Practices](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)

## üìù Security Updates

This security configuration should be reviewed and updated regularly:
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security review
- Annual penetration testing (for production systems)
- Immediate updates for critical vulnerabilities
